# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to resource constraints, the only supported version of this GitHub Action is the latest available version. If you have a security issue with an older version please first test the latest version to see if it has been resolved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have a security-related issue to report, please open a GitHub Issue with a description indicating you want to discuss a security-related bug with the GitHub Action. We will add you as a collaborator to a GitHub Security Advisory to privately discuss the issue with you directly and privately. This also allows you to receive credit for reporting the vulnerability.

Once we have determined that the security issue is valid we will attempt to fix the issue within the next few days. Once the issue has been resolved we will publish the security advisory along with the release of a new version of the GitHub Action.
